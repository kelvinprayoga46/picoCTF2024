# **Binary Search**
## **Description**
Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.
Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools!

## **Hint**
- Have you ever played hot or cold? Binary search is a bit like that.
- You have a very limited number of guesses. Try larger jumps between numbers!
- The program will randomly choose a new number each time you connect. You can always try again, but you should start your binary search over from the beginning - try around 500. Can you think of why?

## **Solution**
- In this challenge, I only guessed the numbers, starting from 500 and so on until I found the correct number.
